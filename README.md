premotedroid
============

Github fork of premotedroid to work on issues pending in google code as developer is non responsive.


Repository replicated from the original and community is requested to submit patches if anyone want to submit any changes.


Updates
=======

I am not very active on the development however i use this software on a regular basis  
and hence require the tool to work in certain way and hence keep modifying it as needed. 
I will make my best efforts to merge all changes as well as 
i have made this repository available in github so that who so ever want can quickly fork the repository  
and make the changes as and when required.


If i see some traction in code base i will try to make it available as a forked version in play store also.
